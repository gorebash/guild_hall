## Guild Hall

### Come for the friends, stay for the friends

Guild Hall is a place to build your local community online.

It is **safe for kids**, and parents have **full visibility** of their children's activities.
There's no private messaging, only the ability to post to your guild.
Even better, there are **no likes and followers** here! Just friends and fun!
